# Cats vs Dogs - Convolutional Neural Network

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to perform binary image classification of the **cats vs. dogs** dataset from Kaggle using TensorFlow / Keras. The goal is to demonstrate a full experiment pipeline: data loading, augmentation, model building, training and evaluation. Furthermore, by applying Transfer Learning, we can compare our results with those obtained from a pre-trained network such as MobileNetV2, which is available in the Keras Applications module.

## Objectives
- Build a simple CNN classifier for cats and dogs images.
- Use `ImageDataGenerator` to load and augment images from directory structure.
- Train and evaluate the model (binary classification).
- Compare different models using Transfer Learning.

## Requirements
Minimum recommended environment:
- Python 3.8+  
- TensorFlow 2.x  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- pillow (PIL)  
- jupyterlab or notebook
